## **Key Queries and Insights:**

- Filtering with WHERE Clause: Extracting specific patient groups.
- Combining Tables with JOIN: Merging patient info with checkup data.
- Top N Records with LIMIT and ORDER BY: Ranking top patients by consultation fee.
- Utilized the LIKE operator in SQL to perform partial string matching in our analysis.
- Grouping with GROUP BY: Analyzing health trends by state or country.
- Subqueries: Incorporating data from one table into another.
